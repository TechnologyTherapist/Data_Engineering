Sure! Here's a sample README file for your DE - ETL pipeline + data modeling project:

# DE - ETL Pipeline + Data Modeling

This project focuses on building an ETL pipeline and creating a data model for US traffic accidents dataset. The pipeline extracts data, transforms it, and loads it into a data model optimized for analysis and reporting.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the US traffic accidents dataset, which contains information about traffic accidents in the United States. It includes various attributes such as accident location, date, severity, weather conditions, and more.

## ETL Pipeline

The ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline consists of the following steps:

1. Extraction: The dataset is obtained from a reliable source, such as a CSV file or a database. In this project, we assume the dataset is available as a CSV file.

2. Transformation: The extracted data is cleaned, filtered, and transformed into a format suitable for analysis and loading into the data model. This step involves tasks like removing duplicate records, handling missing values, standardizing data formats, and creating derived attributes if needed.

3. Loading: The transformed data is loaded into a data model optimized for analysis. This includes creating a fact table and dimension tables based on the dataset's characteristics.

## Fact Table

The fact table in our data model represents the core metrics or events we want to analyze. For the US traffic accidents dataset, some potential attributes to include in the fact table are:

- Accident ID (primary key)
- Date and time of the accident
- Location information (latitude and longitude)
- Severity of the accident
- Weather conditions
- Number of vehicles involved
- Number of injured and/or fatalities

## Dimension Tables

Dimension tables provide additional context and descriptive attributes related to the events in the fact table. Some potential dimension tables for the US traffic accidents dataset could include:

- Date dimension: Includes attributes like day, month, year, day of the week, etc.
- Location dimension: Contains information about the geographical location, such as city, state, country, etc.
- Weather dimension: Provides details about weather conditions, such as temperature, precipitation, visibility, etc.
- Vehicle dimension: Contains attributes related to the vehicles involved in accidents, such as vehicle type, make, model, etc.
- Injury dimension: Includes information about injuries and fatalities, such as type of injury, age group, gender, etc.

## ETL Pipeline Scalability

The chosen approach for the ETL pipeline using Python and Airflow is scalable to handle increased data volumes. Here's how it can handle data growth:

- 10x / 100x: The pipeline can handle increased data volumes by optimizing the data transformation process and leveraging distributed computing frameworks like Apache Spark or cloud-based services like AWS Glue.

- 10,000x: For a significant increase in data size, it may be necessary to redesign the data model and consider distributed databases or data warehousing solutions like Amazon Redshift or Google BigQuery to ensure efficient querying and processing.

## Tools and Technologies

The recommended tools and technologies for this project are:

- Python: Programming language used for data extraction, transformation, and loading tasks.
- Airflow: Open-source platform to schedule, automate, and monitor the ETL pipeline workflow.
- Database or Data Warehouse: A database or data warehouse system to store and query the data model created from the ETL pipeline.

## Getting Started

To run the ETL pipeline and create the data model, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

3. Configure the necessary connection details for data extraction and loading in the `config.py` file.

4. Run the ETL pipeline script using `python etl_pipeline.py`.

5. Monitor the pipeline execution and workflow using Airflow's web interface.

6. Once the pipeline is complete, you can analyze and query the data model using your preferred database management or visualization tool.
